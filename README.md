# DDP Business Inventory Web App

This tool is built for integrating 
data about **Downtown Detroit** and visualizing 
using ArcGIS JavaScript Toolkit. The data 
used in this project came from DDP ArcGIS 
Online Server, Detroit Open Data, and ORBIS 
Database. 

## What it can do ?
By simply clicking parcel of interest or typing parcel address,
 users can see:
1. All information about the parcel in a pretty 
table format.
2. List of businesses inside that parcel.
3. Attribute of the building that parcel belongs to.
